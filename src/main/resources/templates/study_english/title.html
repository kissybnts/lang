			<p>One: Believe in overnight success. You know the story, right? The tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money. You know, the story may seem real, but I bet it's incomplete. If you go investigate further, the guy has done 30 apps before and he has done a master's on the topic, a Ph.D. He has been working on the topic for 20 years.</p>
			<p class="serif grey-text text-darken-1">１つ目は 一夜の成功を信じること 聞かれたことがあるでしょう 技術者が開発した ある携帯アプリが 大当たりして 一夜で大もうけした話 本当らしく聞こえますが 実は その話には裏があります よくよく調べると その技術者は― それまでに 30ものアプリを開発していて しかるべき分野で修士課程を終え 博士号も取得し 20年もの間 その道で 研究を重ねてきているのです</p>
			<p>This is really interesting, I myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight success. I
				come from a humble family, and two weeks before the deadline to apply to MIT, I started the application
				process. And, voila! I got in. People may think it's an overnight success, but that only worked because
				for the 17 years prior to that, I took life and education seriously. Your overnight success story is
				always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment.</p>
			<p>Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you. Constantly, people want to help out, right? All sorts
				of people: your family, your friends, your business partners, they all have opinions on which path you
				should take: "And let me tell you, go through this pipe." But whenever you go inside, there are other
				ways you have to pick as well. And you need to make those decisions yourself. No one else has the
				perfect answers for your life. And you need to keep picking those decisions, right? The pipes are
				infinite and you're going to bump your head, and it's a part of the process.</p>
			<p>Three, and it's very subtle but very important: Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed. So when your
				life is going great, you have put together a great team, and you have growing revenue, and everything is
				set -- time to settle. When I launched my first book, I worked really, really hard to distribute it
				everywhere in Brazil. With that, over three million people downloaded it, over 50,000 people bought
				physical copies. When I wrote a sequel, some impact was guaranteed. Even if I did little, sales would be
				okay. But okay is never okay. When you're growing towards a peak, you need to work harder than ever and
				find yourself another peak. Maybe if I did little, a couple hundred thousand people would read it, and
				that's great already. But if I work harder than ever, I can bring this number up to millions. That's why
				I decided, with my new book, to go to every single state of Brazil. And I can already see a higher peak.
				There's no time to settle down.</p>
			<p>Fourth tip, and that's really important: Believe the fault is someone else's. I constantly see people
				saying, "Yes, I had this great idea, but no investor had the vision to invest." "Oh, I created this
				great product, but the market is so bad, the sales didn't go well." Or, "I can't find good talent; my
				team is so below expectations." If you have dreams, it's your responsibility to make them happen. Yes,
				it may be hard to find talent. Yes, the market may be bad. But if no one invested in your idea, if no
				one bought your product, for sure, there is something there that is your fault. (Laughter) Definitely.
				You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you
				didn't make them happen, it's your fault and no one else's. Be responsible for your dreams.</p>
			<p>And one last tip, and this one is really important as well: Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Once I saw an ad, and it was a lot of friends, they were going up a mountain, it was a very high mountain, and it was a lot of work. You could see that they were sweating and this was tough. And they were going up, and they finally made it to the peak. Of course, they decided to celebrate, right? I'm going to celebrate, so, "Yes! We made it, we're at the top!" Two seconds later, one looks at the other and says, "Okay, let's go down."</p>
